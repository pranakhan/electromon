### Dev Notes
This project is built using Phillip Barbiero's excellent enhanced-electron-react-boilerplate project.

This project comes with a basic scaffold utility (built on inquirer) to quickly add new components to the application. It lets you create both stateful and stateless components, and you also have the option of spinning up Redux boilerplate to integrate them initially to the redux store with a dummy action that you should swap out immediately. Its written in pure node `fs` calls to be cross platform.
* Run `npm run scaffold`
* Fill out the prompts
* Profit!
_You can always edit the scripts yourself to tweak the templates if you don't like it out of the box_
